# **PewpewLandRedux**

A retro-game that's a mashup of all the things I love in a classic platformer, with a modern twist.

# __Features__

__Choose one of three player characters:__

* **BobbyBoy** - A cyborg boy with ranged attacks that can be charged to deliver more powerful attacks and special powers aquired through defeating enemies and bosses.
    * **Pros:** 
      * Ranged attacks to keep enemies at a safe distance.
      * Charged attacks knock enemies backwards to keep the distance for longer. 
      * Protective armor to stay in the game longer.
    
    * **Cons:**
      * Slow movement.
      * Low air-control.
      * Low damage output.
  
* **Chippy** - An acrobatic robot with the ability to scale walls, hover over pits and launch an assault of heavy-hitting melee attacks.
  * **Pros:**
    * Precise, fast movement on both the ground and air.
    * Grappling hand to grab ledges, walls and ceilings and even enemies to keep the air-play going.
    * Battery-powered jet-feet to prolong a landing.
    * Heavy hitting melee attacks that can hit multiple enemies simultaneously.
    
  * **Cons:**
    * Low health.
    * Slow attacks.
    * Battery-powered: Jet-feet and melee combo's use battery life that can only be replenished by collecting health crystals while at full health or from collecting batteries from defeated robot enemies or using portals.
   
   * Mrs.Marlene - An escape artist with a backpack loaded with gadgets for every occasion; from converting herself into an indestructible rolling ball, to phase-shifting (Dashing), punching a hole through-space time with her trusty portal gun, to landing on enemies to smash them out of existence!
   
    * **Pros:**
      * Evade enemies by becoming one, phasing through them or just turn into a ball and keep rolling.
