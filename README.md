# **PewpewLandRedux**

A retro-game that's a mashup of all the things I love in a classic platformer, with a modern twist.

__Features__

* Choose one three player characters:

   * BobbyBoy - A cyborg boy with ranged attacks that can be charged to deliver more powerful attacks and special powers aquired through defeating enemies and bosses.
  
   * Chippy - An acrobatic robot with the ability to scale walls, hover over pits and launch an assault of heavy-hitting melee attacks.
   
   * Mrs.Marlene - An escape artist with a backpack loaded with gadgets for every occasion; from converting herself into an indestructible rolling ball, to phase-shifting (Dashing), punching a hole through-space time with her trusty portal gun to landing on enemies to smash them out of existence!
