# **PewpewLandRedux**

A retro-game that's a mashup of all the things I love in a classic platformer, with a modern twist.

# __Features__

__Choose one of three player characters:__

* **BoppyBoy** - A cyborg boy with ranged attacks that can be charged to deliver more powerful attacks and special powers aquired through defeating enemies and bosses.
    * **Pros:** 
      * Ranged attacks to keep enemies at a safe distance.
      * *Special Shots* (charged attacks) to knock enemies backwards to keep the distance for longer. 
      * Protective armor to stay in the game longer.
      * Resistance to conveyor forces.
    
    * **Cons:**
      * Slow movement.
      * Low air-control.
      * Low damage output.
      * Battery-powered: Special (Charged) attacks use battery life that can only be replenished by collecting health crystals while at full health or from collecting batteries from defeated robot enemies or using portals.
  
* **Chip-Chip** - An acrobatic robot with the ability to scale walls, hover over pits and launch an assault of heavy-hitting melee attacks.
  * **Pros:**
    * Precise, fast movement on both the ground and air.
    * *Grappling-Hand* to grab ledges, walls and ceilings and even enemies to keep the air-play going.
    * Battery-powered *Jet-Boots* to prolong a landing.
    * Heavy hitting melee attacks that can hit multiple enemies simultaneously.
    
  * **Cons:**
    * Low health.
    * Slow attacks.
    * Battery-powered: *Jet-Boots* and melee combo's use battery life that can only be replenished by collecting health crystals while at full health or from collecting batteries from defeated robot enemies or using portals.
   
   * **Mrs.Marlene** - An inventor and escape artist with a backpack loaded with gadgets for every occasion; from converting herself into an indestructible rolling *Elastic Ball*, to *Phase-Dashing* through them, to punching a hole through-space time with her trusty *Singularity Gun*, to landing on enemies to smash them out of existence!
   
    * **Pros:**
      * Evade enemies by becoming one, *Phase-Dashing* through them or just turn into an *Elastic Ball* and just keep rolling.
      * Reach unattainable destinations by  opening *Portals* with the *Singularity Gun*.
      * Throw *Paradox Balls* to freeze time for a short duration. After that duration, an after image will do everything Mrs.Marlene did will time freezes for that same duration, so player-tracking enemies will prioritize the after-image.
      * Average movement and air-control without sacrificing much.
      * Land on (most) enemies to damage them.
      
    * **Cons:**
      * Low friction: She slides more on surfaces when changing directions and has a hard time with coneyors.
      * Can't get batteries filled by health overflow or by using portals.
      * Battery-powered: *Portals* and *Paradox Balls* use battery life that can only be replenished by collecting batteries from defeated robot enemies.
   
__Play anywhere!__

  * Windows, Linux and Android support.

  * From the menu, import/export a save to any file system, cloud or Steam*.
    * For Windows or Linux, saves can be stored via Steam. No Play Store integration exists, currently.
    * Saves are raw text files so that they are unencrypted and easy to read or modify via any text editor.

__Built-In Level Editor For ALL Supported platforms__
  
  * Build levels with tiles, portals, switches, keys and doors.
  
  * Position and plot with over 30 enemies, with modular, simple to use and customize behaviors.
  
  * Fire level-local or global events with trigger-boxes, timelines or on Enemy_Defeated to prompt dialogue boxes with text flavors, spawn new enemies to load into other levels.
    * Loading other levels can be done seamless with a position offset to have a level, with all of it's contents, loaded in asynchronously.
    
  
__Support__
   Currently, the game uses GameMaker: Studio 1.4 and so it is using a version that is no longer officially supported by Yo-Yo Games (creator of GameMaker) and cannot be imported into the newest verion without first updating the code (across the board) and purchasing the desktop, mobile and html modules. So, as it stands now, the game is no longer being developed or maintained.
